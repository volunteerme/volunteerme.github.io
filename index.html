<h2> Our Story </h2>
<p> VolunteerMe began as an entry for the 2014-2015 Verizon Innovative App Challenge. Our team designed an app outline for an app that would help teens find local volunteering opportunities. After winning the contest on a national level, we had the opportunity to develop our app idea into a real app on the Google Play store. We succeeded in developing our app, but we believed it had more potential. Freshman year began for our team and we temporaily abandoned the project. We continued learning to code and volunteering. At last the time came when we decided to meet again, this time deciding to develop a website instead. We are currently in the development stage, so our website is not yet avaiable for use.
